    <p>
      I'm a 19 year old studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. In the rare moment that I'm not coding, 
      you'll find me playing chess, singing A cappella, or sleeping (I love sleep).

      I'm currently looking for internships for the Winter 2020 term (January - April). Feel free to connect with me at 
      <a href="mailto:zoravur.singh@uwaterloo.ca" target="_top"> zoravur.singh@uwaterloo.ca</a>!
